# Features

Implemented socket programming in python as described in the class. I created a server and client file and estabished a connection between them for the first part. For the second part, I tried connecting to various public IPs such as google,yahoo,stackoverflow. I also tried to fetch some information through stackoverflow. The screenshots # the same are attached below:
